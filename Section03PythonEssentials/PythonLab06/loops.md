## Introduction to Loops
Loops are an essential feature in Python, allowing you to repeat a block of code multiple times. They are particularly useful when working with collections, iterating through ranges, or executing code under certain conditions.

## The `for` Loop
The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range). It provides a convenient way to repeat actions with minimal code.

### Iterating Over a Range
Use `range()` to create a sequence of numbers to iterate over:
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

### Iterating Over a String
Strings can also be iterated character by character:
```python
for char in "Python":
    print(char)
```

## The `while` Loop
The `while` loop runs as long as a specified condition remains `True`. It is particularly useful for cases where the number of iterations depends on dynamic conditions.
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements allow for more flexible loop execution by modifying the loop's behavior based on specific conditions.

### `break` Statement
The `break` statement exits the loop prematurely, terminating the loop when a specified condition is met.
```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

### `continue` Statement
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```

### `pass` Statement
The `pass` statement does nothing. Itâ€™s a placeholder often used as a temporary code structure while developing.
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        pass  # Placeholder for future code
    print(i)
```

## Nested Loops
A nested loop is a loop within another loop. Nested loops are helpful for working with multi-dimensional data structures.
```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i: {i}, j: {j}")
```

## Conclusion
Loops are powerful tools in Python that simplify repetitive tasks by allowing code to execute multiple times efficiently. By mastering `for` and `while` loops, along with control statements like `break`, `continue`, and `pass`, you can write more effective and concise programs.
