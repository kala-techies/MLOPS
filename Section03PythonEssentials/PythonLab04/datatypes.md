### Data Types

1. **Definition**  
   - Data types classify data and inform the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use it.
   - They determine the operations that can be performed, the range of values, and the memory required for storage.

2. **Importance of Data Types in Programming**  
   - Data types ensure data is stored efficiently.
   - They enable the execution of correct operations on data.
   - Proper use of data types helps prevent errors and bugs in the program.

3. **Basic Data Types**
   - **Integers** - Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.
   - **Floating-point numbers** - Numbers with decimals, suitable for more precise calculations.
   - **Strings** - Sequences of characters, used for text data.
   - **Booleans** - True or False values, essential for conditional logic.

4. **Advanced Data Types** *(to be discussed in upcoming sessions)*
   - **Lists** - Ordered, mutable collections.
   - **Tuples** - Ordered, immutable collections.
   - **Sets** - Unordered collections of unique elements.
   - **Dictionaries** - Key-value pairs for fast data retrieval.

5. **Type Conversion**
   - Allows changing data from one type to another, enabling compatibility and flexibility in operations.
