# Project Setup Guide

This series will use **Python 3.12**. Follow the steps below to set up your environment, manage dependencies, and run your code efficiently.

> **Tip:** It's recommended to create a separate virtual environment for each project to avoid package conflicts and ensure compatibility.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) installed. Anaconda simplifies the process of creating virtual environments and managing dependencies, making it an ideal choice for Python-based projects.
