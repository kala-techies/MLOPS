# MLOps Repository

Welcome to my MLOps repository! This repo is designed to guide you through the essentials of MLOps, from foundational concepts to hands-on practices for setting up mission-critical pipelines.

## Why MLOps?

MLOps bridges the gap between machine learning (ML) and operational best practices, enabling scalable, reproducible, and reliable ML workflows. If you’re a DevOps engineer or SRE, you're already halfway there, as DevOps principles translate well to the MLOps workflow culture.

Hands-on experience with Git, GitHub, containerization, orchestration, cloud services, monitoring tools, data tools, Python, and relevant frameworks will be key in your MLOps journey. 

## Objectives of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to help people understand MLOps and its significance in the world of ML and software engineering. 

### Target Audience

- **College students**
- **IT professionals with up to 5 years of experience**
- **Continuous learners interested in DevOps and MLOps**

## Repository Structure
